SimpleNewsApp is a typical typical master/detail app to hit the NY Times Most Popular Articles API and show a list of articles,
that shows details when items on the list are tapped.


Used native URLSession for networking (no third party libraries used)

Clean and lightwight app

Can improve in many ways ( by using Alamofire and Kingfisher)
